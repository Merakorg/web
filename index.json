A validator is a server that provides consensus to secure the blockchain. It must be available 24/7 and connected to other validators It must be secured to not compromise the chain integrity It has a private key used to \u0026lsquo;vote\u0026rsquo; for each block How a validator interacts in Cosmos-based chains? Each validator,based on delegated tokens (PoS) has more power and more chances to propose blocks Validators get a commission from each proposed block transactions Stakers get rewards Validator gets commissions Validator votes for proposals and for their delegates unless they vote individually What problems can a validator have? Fail to communicate with others (isolated) Fail to sign blocks DoS attacks (sentries) Double signing Disk filling with blocks RAM filling because of bad optimized chain code Getting out of active set What punishment? Penalties Jailing Slashing Tombstoning Choosing the right validator (1) Always DYOR Avoid top 10 validators (decentralization, participation in airdrops, etc) Check for experience in other networks Check Validator in the explorer (missing blocks, delegations, etc) Check for participation in voting Choosing the right validator (2) Avoid 0% validators -\u0026gt; they play badly against community Check maximum commission change Experience in testnets (what is tested in test, doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect you in production) reStake support (via authz) Authz Cosmos chains might include support for Authz Authz allows to grant certain privileges to other accounts Being incorporated in major chains Enables use of restake restake Restake uses authz support to grant permissions to a validator for: Claiming rewards by delegator to the validator Delegate the rewards to the same validator Restake operator (the validator), will pay the fees for the claim and delegate APY increases as restake executes periodically doing compound interest Min # of tokens in rewards Every \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo; period of time restake function Validator prepares a wallet that will keep the funds for the fees and will get the auth grant Profile is updated in repository containing parameters (periodicity and min # of tokens) Periodicity in the repo doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be the real one Funds are needed in the wallet for restake to cover the fees restake function (cont) Verifies the available funds on bot account The software executes and reviews all delegators for authz permissions minimum # of rewards When verified, claim+stake is performed Links Restake profile (you can switch between networks) Cosmos Intro Blockchain for begginers Cosmos Airdrops (one of many sites) ","permalink":"https://merak.run/presentations/cosmos-and-restake/cosmos-and-restake/","summary":"Introduction In this presentation we\u0026rsquo;re going to cover some of the basics of Cosmos ecosystem and what is the work of validators and what they provide.\nWhat is Cosmos?

A validator must provide a high uptime to avoid slashing, that is, getting a loss of the tokens delegated to them for not helping the network be secured. In order to avoid that, the best option is to have a new server installed, configured and running until it completely syncs the chain\u0026hellip; depending on the chain time running and validator settings about pruning, it might take more or less time to get it done.\nAvoid double-signing\nFrom this point, have extra caution, your node might perform double signing and be tombstoned.\nSetup the new validator following the project documentation:\nrestore account instead of creating new one sync the chain etc. Once the new validator is up and synced, there\u0026rsquo;s a missing and important key file to copy over: .$chain/config/priv_validator_key.json, but first, read the next steps for safety.\nMake really sure to:\nstop the previous validator server, disable autostart of daemons, monitoring that might re-run it, etc Double check on the chain explorer that the validator is no longer signing blocks. As a security measure, you can move the .$chain/ folder to a new name, to make sure that by any chance the validator can start again. copy the .$chain/data/priv_validator_state.json to the remote new server, in this way, the validator knows the last block it saw. you can additionally rsync the changes from the data folder from the old validator to the data folder of the new one. Once the file .$chain/config/priv_validator_key.json has been put in place on your new validator, and the service started, the validator will quickly start syncing the blocks that might have changed during the downtime and start signing again.\nAs final steps:\nCheck on the explorer that the validator is signing Reenable monitoring scripts on the new validator and check that everything is reported fine. Nuke the old server If you provide services over the validator name (rpc, etc), make sure to update DNS to point to the new one Good luck!\n","permalink":"https://merak.run/blog/relocating/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this question on one of the forums I participate and wanted to document it a bit, with not too much specifics to give some clues about the process and things to avid.\nRelocating a server usually it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of installing the new one, adding the services, software etc.\nThis operation can be made in an easier way if the deployment is automated.\nFor example, I do use a common set of playbooks in Ansible to configure, install, etc all my servers in a similar way, also creating helper commands I can use for doing some standard operations and monitoring.","title":"Relocating a validator"},{"content":"Merak has added restake support for the validator, you can find the current active links in the validator page.\nIn short, restake, via the link provided, allows you, as delegator to autocompound the earnings from staking for free.\nYou can click on the icons in the networks field in the profile tab to select the validator in other networks where restaking is supported by the validator.\nHow it works?
