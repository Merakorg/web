      <title>Shutting down operations on Sifchain</title>

      <description>Hi all,
Because of current Sifchain status, lack of clear roadmap and development, we&amp;rsquo;re ceasing operations on 31 December.
This is not the only movement here as it has been preceded by other validators with similar feelings about this.
Good luck and see you on other chains!
Thanks for your support.</description>

      <title>Cosmos ecosystem and restake</title>

      <description>Introduction In this presentation we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover some of the basics of Cosmos ecosystem and what is the work of validators and what they provide.
What is Cosmos? Ecosystem based on consensus Uses Tendermint code for Consensus: 2/3 of voting power must agree What problems can chain have? Centralization (too few validators have &amp;gt; 66% voting power) Chain halt because of lost keys or DoS Security issues (on apps or in cosmos itself) Ecosystem Cosmos is a very rich ecosystem that can be interconected via IBC Many different projects and goals: ATOM, NYM, Sifchain, UMEE, Evmos, GenesisL1, Juno, Osmosis, etc Many projects perform airdrops to stakers in other projects What is a validator?</description>

      <description>As you already know, staking allows you to get rewards by depositing your tokens on a validator.
Merak has restake support enabled, so it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to take profit of it!
First you need to delegate tokens to the validator in the traditional way, either via restake.app or via your preferred wallet.
If you&amp;rsquo;re using restake you&amp;rsquo;ll see a dialog similar to this: Once it&amp;rsquo;s done, if you visit the list of delegations, it will show that Auto-compounding requires to fix permissions:</description>

      <title>Relocating a validator</title>

      <guid>https://merak.run/blog/relocating/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this question on one of the forums I participate and wanted to document it a bit, with not too much specifics to give some clues about the process and things to avid.
Relocating a server usually it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of installing the new one, adding the services, software etc.
This operation can be made in an easier way if the deployment is automated.
For example, I do use a common set of playbooks in Ansible to configure, install, etc all my servers in a similar way, also creating helper commands I can use for doing some standard operations and monitoring.</description>

      <description>Merak has added restake support for the validator, you can find the current active links in the validator page.
In short, restake, via the link provided, allows you, as delegator to autocompound the earnings from staking for free.
You can click on the icons in the networks field in the profile tab to select the validator in other networks where restaking is supported by the validator.
How it works? Using AuthZ support in some chains, your wallet grants access to the validator to claim rewards in your name and delegate them again to the same validator, meaning that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do that manually (and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to pay the fees for it, as those are paid by the validator itself).</description>

      <description>Sometimes we want to exchange tokens between them, and many times the easiest way is to use a Swap page.
Those pages connect to your wallet, like Metamask, and ask for approval for interacting with your tokens.
With those interactions will allow you to select the tokens to use as source (funds) and target from a list, or via their contract so that you can exchange them.

      <description>When a wallet interacts, for example, Metamask, it might require approvals for interaction with the wallet.
Sometimes, those contracts might be fraudulent or malicious and, you forget about them when time passes but still have access to your funds.
You can check the current approved ones via the following sites, depending on the network you&amp;rsquo;re using on your wallet:
Ethereum https://approved.zone/ https://tac.dappstar.io/ https://revoke.cash/ https://app.unrekt.net/ https://debank.com https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker Polygon https://polygonscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker Binance Smart Chain https://bscscan.</description>
