      <description>Introduction In this presentation we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover some of the basics of Cosmos ecosystem and what is the work of validators and what they provide.
What is Cosmos? Ecosystem based on consensus Uses Tendermint code for Consensus: 2/3 of voting power must agree What problems can chain have? Centralization (too few validators have &amp;gt; 66% voting power) Chain halt because of lost keys or DoS Security issues (on apps or in cosmos itself) Ecosystem Cosmos is a very rich ecosystem that can be interconected via IBC Many different projects and goals: ATOM, NYM, Sifchain, UMEE, Evmos, GenesisL1, Juno, Osmosis, etc Many projects perform airdrops to stakers in other projects What is a validator?</description>

      <description>As you already know, staking allows you to get rewards by depositing your tokens on a validator.
Merak has restake support enabled, so it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to take profit of it!
First you need to delegate tokens to the validator in the traditional way, either via restake.app or via your preferred wallet.
If you&amp;rsquo;re using restake you&amp;rsquo;ll see a dialog similar to this: Once it&amp;rsquo;s done, if you visit the list of delegations, it will show that Auto-compounding requires to fix permissions:</description>

      <title>Restake support</title>

      <description>Merak has added restake support for the validator, you can find the current active links in the validator page.
In short, restake, via the link provided, allows you, as delegator to autocompound the earnings from staking for free.
You can click on the icons in the networks field in the profile tab to select the validator in other networks where restaking is supported by the validator.
How it works? Using AuthZ support in some chains, your wallet grants access to the validator to claim rewards in your name and delegate them again to the same validator, meaning that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do that manually (and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to pay the fees for it, as those are paid by the validator itself).</description>
